I will provide you with an image. You must determine the precise center location within the image and a prediction of 
the boundary of the image by predicting a radius from the center. Your return format should be the center location 
name followed by a space, then the radius. Based on that, provide only one complete address in a single, consistent 
format followed by a space and a radius. Do not include any extraneous text before or after the address.
